This summer, during the Academy of Management Conference, Christina Wawarta, Georg Reischauer, and I will organize an online symposium. We will discuss the role of digitization in strategizing with a panel of experts. 

What is the matter? Digital technologies such as platforms, big data analytics, and algorithms are reshaping how firms strategize. A first effect is altering the strategy-making process, which has become less exclusive and secret, and more flexible. Second, digital technologies are also redefining strategy-making practices, allowing actors to participate from afar or utilizing the wisdom of the crowd. 

We want to discuss these two effects, their significance for business, and their influence on the strategic management research agenda. 

Who will be "on the stage" with us? Stefan Haefliger (Cass Business School, UK) Julia Hautz (U. of Innsbruck, AUT), Ann Majchrzak (U. of Southern California, USA), Stella Pachidi (U. of Cambridge, UK), Sotirios Paroutis (Warwick Business School, UK), Richard Whittington (U. of Oxford, UK).

Stay tuned and connect on Twitter, where we will post live tweets!
