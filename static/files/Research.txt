Research

My research focuses on coordination mechanisms in organizations and behavioral drivers of strategic actions in platform markets. Theoretically, my interests lie at the intersection of organizational design and two-sided markets'  literature. To study these topics, I use both qualitative (fs/QCA, case studies), and quantitative methods (linear regression, simultaneous equations, maximum likelihood).
