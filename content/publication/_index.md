My research focuses on coordination mechanisms in organizations and behavioral drivers of strategic actions in platform markets. Theoretically, my interests lie at the intersection of **organizational design** and **two-sided markets'  literature**. To study these topics, I use both **qualitative** (fs/QCA, case studies), and **quantitative** methods (linear regression, simultaneous equations, maximum likelihood).
