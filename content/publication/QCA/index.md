abstract: The issue of value appropriation from innovation is a centerpiece of firmsâ€™ innovation strategies. Appropriability through successful patent protection occurs due to a hierarchical structure in the R&D decision-making, a certain level of cross-functionality between the organizational units involved, and the codification of information in the application process. However, the interaction between these coordination mechanisms remains open to debate. This study explores this interplay by adopting a configurational perspective and analyzing 20 cases using the fsQCA approach. Our findings explore the synergies derived from the intersection of coordination mechanisms for appropriability and identify which are core versus peripheral. The results suggest that centralizing both decision-making and cross-functionality are core to appropriability when combined in an organization. However, both mechanisms become ancillary when in a configuration with formalization through planning.
