Half a year into 2022 central banks are poised to keep raising interest rates, supply chains are hobbled and a war is raging in Europe. As this harrowing mix turned markets tumultuous and zapped investorsâ€™ confidence, what does it mean for VC-backed investment? In this [blog post](https://diagonalising.com/posts/2022-06-22-innovation-capital/), Christoph Feest and I argue that trends in policy and digitalisation feed an undiminished appetite and need for venture backing, leading to increased, more-broadly sourced and more widely-distributed investments.
<!-- This summer, during the **Academy of Management Conference**, [Christina Wawarta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KIuvTCcAAAAJ&hl=en/), [Georg Reischauer ](https://sites.google.com/view/greischauer/) and I will organize an online symposium. We will discuss the role of **digitization in strategizing** with a panel of experts.  -->

<!-- What is the matter? Digital technologies such as platforms, big data analytics, and algorithms are reshaping how firms strategize. A first effect is **altering the strategy-making process**, which has become less exclusive and secret, and more flexible. Second, digital technologies are also **redefining strategy-making practices**, allowing actors to participate from afar or utilizing the wisdom of the crowd.  -->

<!-- We want to discuss these two effects, their significance for business, and their influence on the strategic management research agenda. -->

<!-- Who will be "on the stage" with us? **Stefan Haefliger** (Cass Business School, UK) **Julia Hautz** (U. of Innsbruck, AUT), **Ann Majchrzak** (U. of Southern California, USA), **Stella Pachidi** (U. of Cambridge, UK), **Sotirios Paroutis** (Warwick Business School, UK), **Richard Whittington** (U. of Oxford, UK). -->

<!-- Stay tuned and connect on Twitter, where we will post live tweets! -->
