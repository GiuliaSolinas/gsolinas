<p>This summer, during the <strong>Academy of Management Conference</strong>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KIuvTCcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en/">Christina Wawarta</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/greischauer/">Georg Reischauer</a> and I will organize an online symposium. We will discuss the role of <strong>digitization in strategizing</strong> with a panel of experts.</p>
<p>What is the matter? Digital technologies such as platforms, big data analytics, and algorithms are reshaping how firms strategize. A first effect is <strong>altering the strategy-making process</strong>, which has become less exclusive and secret, and more flexible. Second, digital technologies are also <strong>redefining strategy-making practices</strong>, allowing actors to participate from afar or utilizing the wisdom of the crowd.</p>
<p>We want to discuss these two effects, their significance for business, and their influence on the strategic management research agenda.</p>
<p>Who will be “on the stage” with us? <strong>Stefan Haefliger</strong> (Cass Business School, UK) <strong>Julia Hautz</strong> (U. of Innsbruck, AUT), <strong>Ann Majchrzak</strong> (U. of Southern California, USA), <strong>Stella Pachidi</strong> (U. of Cambridge, UK), <strong>Sotirios Paroutis</strong> (Warwick Business School, UK), <strong>Richard Whittington</strong> (U. of Oxford, UK).</p>
<p>Stay tuned and connect on Twitter, where we will post live tweets!</p>
