<p><strong>How can platforms help fight grand challenges? How should they be designed to contribute to sustainability?</strong></p>
<p>Mission-driven platforms like Amnesty International Decoder and Humanitarian OpenStreetMap are on the rise. These societal platforms address challenges such as fighting poverty, education, climate actions, and sustainable cities and communities on a large scale and at speed by orchestrating an ecosystem and creating value for the market and society.</p>
<p>Practice generally highlights that the platform’s philanthropic nature and the pro-social mission determine a very peculiar design and governance for those organizations. Yet, research in the field is still scarce.</p>
