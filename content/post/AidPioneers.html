<!-- This summer, during the **Academy of Management Conference**, [Christina Wawarta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KIuvTCcAAAAJ&hl=en/), [Georg Reischauer ](https://sites.google.com/view/greischauer/) and I will organize an online symposium. We will discuss the role of **digitization in strategizing** with a panel of experts.  -->
<!-- What is the matter? Digital technologies such as platforms, big data analytics, and algorithms are reshaping how firms strategize. A first effect is **altering the strategy-making process**, which has become less exclusive and secret, and more flexible. Second, digital technologies are also **redefining strategy-making practices**, allowing actors to participate from afar or utilizing the wisdom of the crowd.  -->
<!-- We want to discuss these two effects, their significance for business, and their influence on the strategic management research agenda. -->
<!-- Who will be "on the stage" with us? **Stefan Haefliger** (Cass Business School, UK) **Julia Hautz** (U. of Innsbruck, AUT), **Ann Majchrzak** (U. of Southern California, USA), **Stella Pachidi** (U. of Cambridge, UK), **Sotirios Paroutis** (Warwick Business School, UK), **Richard Whittington** (U. of Oxford, UK). -->
