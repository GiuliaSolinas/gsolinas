I am a data scientist and AI consultant working on NLP and LLM models. I was faculty at the Institute for Strategy, Technology, and Innovation of the [Munich School of Management (LMU Munich)](https://www.som.lmu.de/de/index.html) and the University of Liverpool Management School. My research used to look into how organizations coordinate their tasks to manage innovation and digitization. Empirically, I focus on the pharmaceutical industry and micro-finance platforms. When not busy researching, I enjoy hiking and cycling with my family. I am a pizza and golden retriever lover.
