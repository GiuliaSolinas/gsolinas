I am an assistant professor at the [Institute for Strategy, Technology, and Innovation](https://www.en.isto.bwl.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) of the [Munich School of Management (LMU Munich)](https://www.bwl.uni-muenchen.de/index.html). My research explores how organizations coordinate their tasks to manage innovation and digitization. Empirically, I focus on the pharmaceutical industry and micro-finance platforms. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and cycling. I am a pizza lover.
