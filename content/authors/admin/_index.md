I am an assistant professor at the [Institute for Strategy, Technology, and Innovation](https://www.som.lmu.de/isto/en/index.html) of the [Munich School of Management (LMU Munich)](https://www.som.lmu.de/de/index.html) (in maternity leave since June 2022). My research explores how organizations coordinate their tasks to manage innovation and digitization. Empirically, I focus on the pharmaceutical industry and micro-finance platforms. When not busy researching, I enjoy hiking and cycling with my family. I am a pizza and golden retriever lover.
