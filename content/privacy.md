I. GENERAL INFORMATION ON DATA PROCESSING
The website processes the personal users' data only to the extent required to provide a functioning website. As a rule, the users' personal data are processed only with the consent of the user through third-parties plugins. 

II. TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD PARTIES

The website uses content from third-party providers. These are, for example, so-called social plugins of the social networks Facebook and Twitter, which have established themselves as the standard in the media world and are important for the dissemination of the website's content. 

The website protects users privacy by not directly incorporating third-party content unless users have expressly consented to its display through the cookie consent banner. If users have not agreed to the cookie consent banner, the website expressly points this out in order to protect data from the display of external content and the transfer of data to third parties. Users can then consent to the transfer of data themselves and have the content displayed with a click (so-called two-click solution). The legal basis for processing the data after the user has given his consent is Article 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a GDPR.
