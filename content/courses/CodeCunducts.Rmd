I am available to act as advisor for theses related to **digital platforms**, the **strategic implications of digital transformation**, **organizational design**, and the **strategic management of innovation**. On these topics, I supervise both qualitative and quantitative studies, and literature reviews.

Look at the `Topics` for initial ideas that could match with my research interests. 

## Code of conducts

* Please, contact me **one month in advance** respect to your expected registration date. We will use this time window to brainstorm a suitable topic and look for opportunities to collect data. 
* I am expecting to see you and receive your updates regularly. It is your responsibility to get in touch with me and schedule the appointments.
* I believe in collaborative and open research and I will ask you to **share your codes and analysis results via Dropbox or a collaborative folder**. 
* If you decide to work with quantitative data, I recommend using either `R` (open-source) or `STATA` (license-based). If you opt for STATA, you should have free access through the library computers. Otherwise, you can buy a discounted student license. 
* `Coding` can be messy while you progress in your analysis. I recommend writing a final script to summarize the blocks of your code at the end of your thesis. Please, include a readme.file if the code needs further specification. 

## Formal details

* At ISTO, we register the incoming theses on the **first Monday of each month**.
* Once agreed on a topic, I will send you the registration form. 
* Visit the [ISTO institutional webpage](https://www.isto.bwl.uni-muenchen.de/studium_lehre/abschluss/index.html/)
 for the formal requirements (length, page style, etc.).
