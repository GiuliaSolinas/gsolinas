Teaching is for me a wonderful opportunity to make an **impact** on society by training the new generations and leveraging their critical thinking and analytical skills. When in a classroom, I blend frontal lessons with interactive sessions based on class discussions, which should be stimulating and solution driven. 

I had the opportunity of **translating my research knowledge into teaching contents**. My teaching portfolio comprehends courses at the bachelor, master and executive level in the fields of corporate strategic management, organizational design, platforms, and innovation. 

You will find the **up-to-date overview of the courses** I am currently teaching at [my institutional webpage](https://www.en.isto.bwl.uni-muenchen.de/team/ass_prof/giulia_solinas/index.html/).
