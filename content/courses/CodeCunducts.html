<p>I am available to act as advisor for theses related to <strong>digital platforms</strong>, the <strong>strategic implications of digital transformation</strong>, <strong>organizational design</strong>, and the <strong>strategic management of innovation</strong>. On these topics, I supervise both qualitative and quantitative studies, and literature reviews.</p>
<p>Look at the <code>Topics</code> for initial ideas that could match with my research interests.</p>
<div id="code-of-conducts" class="section level2">
<h2>Code of conducts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Please, contact me <strong>one month in advance</strong> respect to your expected registration date. We will use this time window to brainstorm a suitable topic and look for opportunities to collect data.</li>
<li>I am expecting to see you and receive your updates regularly. It is your responsibility to get in touch with me and schedule the appointments.</li>
<li>I believe in collaborative and open research and I will ask you to <strong>share your codes and analysis results via Dropbox or a collaborative folder</strong>.</li>
<li>If you decide to work with quantitative data, I recommend using either <code>R</code> (open-source) or <code>STATA</code> (license-based). If you opt for STATA, you should have free access through the library computers. Otherwise, you can buy a discounted student license.</li>
<li><code>Coding</code> can be messy while you progress in your analysis. I recommend writing a final script to summarize the blocks of your code at the end of your thesis. Please, include a readme.file if the code needs further specification.</li>
</ul>
