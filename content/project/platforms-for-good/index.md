Platforms have become ubiquitous, and their economic relevance is prominent. They have transformed sectors, shaping the competitive advantage of long-standing players, their practices, and their dynamics. 

Platforms have a crucial influence on market competitiveness, for example, among vendors or between platform providers. Instead, the **contribution of platforms to social change** is poorly examined despite an expanding array of public and private initiatives.

The **microfinance industry** has also seen an evolution due to the rise of digital platforms. Lendings that used to be granted in local networks can now aspire for a global reach; information transparency has increased. 

In front of these fundamental changes, **some relationships might change, while others remain unaltered**. For example, the comparison between microlending institutions becomes more complicated. Organizations can **benchmark themselves with the other peers active on the platform**. Viceversa, **culture** should remain a stable trait that shapes interactions in the micro-lending industry, when this one goes digital. But is it the case? 

On this topic, I have written few blog posts and organized several workshops. Yoou cna check my Engagement page if interested. Would you feel sharing your insight on the topic, don't hesitate to get in contact.
