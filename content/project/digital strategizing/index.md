I am part of the research network "Digital Strategizing", funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Projekt number 422808692). The team leaders are Thomas Gegenhuber (Leuphana University, DE), Maximilian Heimstädt (Weizenbaum Institute, DE), Georg Reischauer (WU Vienna, AU), and Violetta Splitter (University of Zurich, CH).

Digital technologies increasingly affect the process of strategy-making – they impact how actors craft, understand, and execute strategies. In the context of digitalization, new strategy practices emerged, such as strategy blogging or crowdsourcing. With the rise of new digital technologies, strategy is increasingly open, including lower-level employees or outside stakeholders. Finally, algorithms and digital tools might increase the velocity of strategic decision making. 

Taking stock of the current debate, we discuss and analyze how digital transformantion shapes: 
- **strategy practices**, which refer to sets of meaningful routinized activities related to strategy making;
- **strategy practitioners**, who are the actors who deploy strategizing activities; 
- **strategy praxis**, which refers to the actual activities or performance of strategy practitioners in enacting their practices.

We post regularly our updates on our research blog <https://digital-strategizing.org>.
