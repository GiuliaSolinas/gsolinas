Platforms have become ubiquitous, and their economic relevance is prominent. They have transformed sectors, shaping the competitive advantage of long-standing players, their practices, and their dynamics. 

The **microfinance industry** has also seen an evolution due to the rise of digital platforms. Lendings that used to be granted in local networks can now aspire for a global reach; information transparency has increased. 

In front of these fundamental changes, **some relationships might change, while others remain unaltered**. For example, the comparison between microlending institutions becomes more complicated. Organizations can **benchmark themselves with the other peers active on the platform**. Viceversa, **culture** should remain a stable trait that shapes interactions in the micro-lending industry, when this one goes digital. But is it the case? 

This research stream is under development. Stay tuned for more content to come. Would you feel sharing your insight on the topic, don't hesitate to get in contact.
